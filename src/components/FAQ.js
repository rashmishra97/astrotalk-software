          First of all, the credit for astrology and the predictions we make
          here being so accurate goes to the 100s of learned and
          astrologically-versed astrologers we have on board. And to answer what
          makes astrology so accurate, then it is the pure knowledge of our
          astrologers about the planets, planetary configurations,
          constellations and learning of how they influence human life and
          behaviour as they move, shift or even stay still. Astrology is not
          some random guesswork but science that entails scientific principles
          that were sketched by learned Gurus 1000s of years ago and have not
          changed to date. These gurus studied the movement of planets and how
          their aura influences the life of people on earth. The antiquity of
          astrology is revealed from the fact that millions of people continue
          to stay connected with it due to the accuracy it has to offer.
          Astrology has changed the lives of millions of people through us and
          many other astrologers who continue to share their knowledge of
          astrology one prediction at a time.

            <strong>Is Astrology Prediction True?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people have misconceptions that an astrologer can tell them
            what exactly is going to happen with them in the future or next
            moment, which is a wrong way to think about astrology. Astrology
            predictions are based on planetary movements. A planet moves from
            one house to another, one zodiac sign to another, etc. These moments
            by plantes can either be good or unfavourable for the native. For
            example, if say the planet Mercury is camping in a friendly zodiac
            sign, the outcomes are to be good for the native. Meanwhile, if the
            mercury is camping in an unfriendly zodiac sign, the outcome can be
            critical. An astrologer, based on calculations, notes down such
            shifts and traits and based on the same share with you if your
            upcoming time would be good or tough. If you think this way,
            astrology predictions ought to be true. Accurate predictions are
            possible when you seek to know about things like upcoming shubh
            muhurats, whether you are manglik or not?, etc.

              How Can Online Astrology Help Me In Predicting The Future?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Online astrology can be of two types. One, you can visit a website
            and find astrology tools available on the same. Then all you need to
            do is enter some details like your date of birth, time of your
            birth, place of birth, etc. and you will have for yourself a
            contentful report describing you better than anyone else ever would.
            Meanwhile, the other way around is to directly get in touch with the
            astrologers (over a call or chat) we have on board to get the same
            information in a much detailed manner. Online astrology may look
            modern but when it comes to making predictions about your future,
            the old school way of calculating the position of the stars and
            planets is used to provide you the most accurate results. Simply
            say, online astrology is just a change of mode of communication
            between an astrologer and the one who seeks to know about their
            past, present and future. However, the ways to come to these answers
            is still old school and one one of the most authentic one.

            Until you are being respectful and authentic about your queries,
            there isn't a limit to what you can chat with an astrologer and what
            you can’t. Astrology has an answer for literally anything and
            everything. Starting right from your career to your love life or
            health, astrology can predict endless queries. You can trust us when
            we say our astrologers have been inundated with some of the most
            difficult questions, which they have answered with ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Are you a manglik? An astrologer can help you find that. Or what the
            shubh muhurat for getting married? Or what are the chances of you
            improving your financial position in the years to come? Our
            astrologers can answer all such questions by simply calculating the
            position of the planets and combining them with numerous factors
            like your nakshatra, zodiac signs, houses in astrology and more.

            <strong>Can Astrology Predictions Be Changed?</strong>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div _ngcontent-serverapp-c103="" class="faq-description">
          <p>Astrological predictions may change in several cases:</p>
          <p>
            The first is when an astrologer unintentionally makes a mistake in
            locating the position of the planets. In such a case, the
            predictions can go wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, if you have provided the wrong information, especially the
            date and time of your birth, then astrology predictions are subject
            to change.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third situation when astrology predictions can go wrong is when
            you try to change yourself for good or bad. Many of you must be
            thinking that how an astrological prediction can change when it is
            mostly based on the movement of planets (which does not change)?
            Well, there is more to it. Every planet rules some good traits and
            bad traits. And it’s your deeds that decides which traits of the
            planet will become powerful. So for example, if you are a careless
            person as of now with Mercury as your ruling planet, you are unable
            to gain the good effects of Mercury. However, if you try to change
            yourself with time, the good traits of Mercury will eventually
            reflect in your chart and personality thus changing the astrology
            prediction.

            <strong>Can Astrology Predict About Lottery Winning?</strong>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div _ngcontent-serverapp-c103="" class="faq-description">
          <p>
            Astrology can’t predict if you will win a lottery today or not but
            it can surely help you predict what are your chances to win a
            lottery. Also, numerology is another form of prediction that can
            help you with lucky numbers prospects, which can eventually help you
            decide what number you can go with to get lucky with winning a
            lottery.

            By seeing your astrological chart, an astrologer can not only
            predict about you but also about your behaviour towards your family,
            your relatives, your colleagues and more. Learning about these
            behaviours can help you better present yourself in front of people
            that matter. This way, astrology can positively help you improve

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How much does Astrotalk cost?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply put, Astrotalk suits your budget. And if you consider the
            First Chat Free feature, then it will definitely suit your budget.
            On Astrotalk, a user can get services at as low as Rs 10 per minute
            to Rs 250 per minute. The astrologers on Astrotalk charge as per
            their experiences, both in personal life and their time on the app.
            So it doesn’t mean an astrologer who is charging low is not good. It
            could simply mean that he/she may have just started on the app and
            thus want to keep his/her price affordable for the user.
            Interestingly, some astrologers deliberately keep their consultation
            prices low as their prime motive is to only help others with their
            talent. In a nutshell, you will find both affordable and not so
            budget-friendly astrologers on Astrotalk but at the end of the day,
            all of them are best at what they do as they have been scrutinised
            by the expert astrologers before they make it to the app.
